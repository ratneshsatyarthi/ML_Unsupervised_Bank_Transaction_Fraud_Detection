# ML_Unsupervised_Bank_Transaction_Fraud_Detection
This project detects fraudulent bank transactions using machine learning and statistical methods on a dataset of 2,500 records. It combines multiple anomaly detection techniques with a Random Forest model to deliver accurate, real-time fraud predictions through an automated pipeline.

**Bank Fraud Detection and Analysis**

This project aims to detect fraudulent bank transactions in a dataset of 2,500 records using a robust combination of machine learning and statistical techniques. It features an automated framework capable of making real-time predictions on new transactions by classifying them as "Fraud" or "Non-Fraud" based on learned patterns.

The workflow includes comprehensive data exploration, feature engineering, outlier treatment, and scaling, followed by unsupervised anomaly detection methods like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest. Key features are rigorously selected using statistical tests to optimize model performance. A Random Forest classifier, enhanced by SMOTE to address class imbalance, drives the high-accuracy fraud prediction.

An end-to-end automated pipeline preprocesses incoming transactions and provides immediate, clear fraud risk assessments, enabling real-time, scalable deployment for practical fraud detection.
